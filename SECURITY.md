# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Codesphere seriously. Given that Codesphere is a distribution of VS Code, vulnerabilities can exist either at the distribution layer (our scripts and configurations) or the core IDE layer.

### How to Report
Please **do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead, send a detailed report to our security contact (e.g., security@codesphere-ide.org or via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting if enabled).

Your report should include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (Proof of Concept).
- Potential impact.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release of Codesphere based on the current stable version of VSCodium. We recommend all users keep their IDE up-to-date to benefit from upstream security patches.

## Sovereignty Audit

One of the primary goals of Codesphere is to eliminate third-party telemetry. If you discover a previously unknown network connection to a corporate endpoint, we treat this as a high-priority privacy bug.
